## Planning Story
I was very methodical with the planning for this project. Here is an outline, in chronological order of the steps taken to build this app:

+ Set Up
+ API Sign Up
+ Analyze Data
+ Build Route
+ Axios Request
+ Format Data for UI
+ Final Touches
### User Stories

+ As a user, I want to be able to view the current temperature in my city.
+ As a user, I want to be able to view the climatic conditions.
+ As a user, I want to be able to view the weather in other cities.
+ As a user, I want to be able to save my cities.

### Technologies Used

* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* React

### Unsolved Problems

Yet to be released in a stable form: user will have the ability to pin the current weather in a city of their choice to the home screen.
